pyolus: python wrapper around Aeolus data structures

Aeolus is a virtual pipe organ for Linux created by Fons Adriaensen:

http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/aeolus/index.html

The stop definitions (synthesis parameters) are stored in a custom binary
format in .ae0-Files and can only be edited via the built-in stop editor.
This module uses boost::python to wrap the corresponding data structures so
that you can read, write, explore and change these stop definitions from
within your own python programs.

To build it, you need to have the Aeolus source code; it's available on the
page linked above. The Makefile assumes that the aeolus source folder is on
the same level than the pyolus folder. Furthermore, you need to have the
boost python library from http://www.boost.org

Please dont't hesitate to contact me with questions - especially in this
undocumented state!
